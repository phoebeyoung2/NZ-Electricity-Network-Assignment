This was an assignment we were given ~ 1 week to complete. The objective was to become more familiar with abstract data types by implementing a network class. My lecturer created a class NetworkElectricNZ, which only becomes fully functional when the classes and methods called within it are created. 

A network is a series of nodes connected by singly directed arcs. This repository contains my implementation of network, node and arc classes, as well as methods for these classes which were add_node, add_arc, read_network respectively. These functions are inside the 'classes.py' file. 

Once these classes and methods were implemented, I was able to use unit testing and class NetworkElectricNZ to determine if I had correctly implemented the classes and their methods.
Inside the test.py file I wrote unit tests to check each method was working.
